# Hack.lu CTF 2014: Holy Moses

**Description:**

> The craziest saloon in town, called Holy Moses, is throwing one of their crazy parties again. As usually they have a special VIP area, with the hottest people, free drinks and a private band. Each time you hear people talking about it how crazy and amazing it was. But to gain access to the area you need a special invite code and unfortunately for you, you donâ€™t know anybody to get you one. But you are lucky, they have a online service running to enter referal codes and request an invite code. Maybe the programmer did a crappy job and you find a way to gain access to the server and retrieve the invite code (file called `flag`). Good luck.
