**Category:** Reverse-engineering
**Points:** 300
**Description:**

> Run this [binary](re300) with the same username you are logged in with. Once you find a valid password and token, enter it below:
>
> Username: `[_]`
> Password: `[_]`
> Token: `[_]`
>
> **Update 04/26 16:15 CEST:** New binary - md5 is `cd1eb7ced07cc6f872537d0618630c0c` - new strings, but offsets stayed the same.
>
> **Update 04/26 21:33 CEST:**
> The allowed charset for password and token is `A-Za-z0-9`. Players with whitespaces in the name - please remove the w hitespaces in the solution, as shown below.
