## Write-up

[The provided `bo` file](bo) is an ELF executable:

```bash
$ file bo
bo: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, not stripped
```

This may not be the intended solution, but simply looking for ASCII strings in the binary reveals the flag:

```bash
$ strings bo | grep 'flag'
flag{exploitation_is_easy!}
```

Alternatively, you could open the file in [IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml) (which is what the challenge actually suggests if you run it) and click _View_ → _Open Subviews_ → _Strings_.

The flag is `exploitation_is_easy!`.
