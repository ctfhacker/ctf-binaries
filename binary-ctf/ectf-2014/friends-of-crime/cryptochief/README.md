# Hack.lu CTF 2014: Cryptochief

**Category:** Reversing
**Points:** 400
**Author:** chief
**Description:**

> Lucky,
> everybody knows you can shoot faster than your shadow, but can you also reverse and break this crypto before your shadow finds out the secret? To give you some kind of challenge, I encrypted the file with the 256 bit fullbit encryption by cryptochief (original), good luck with cracking that! Iâ€™ll give you one hit, though; the md5 sum of the decrypted file is `2aa0ce19d626a687517255f68e4e7640`.
