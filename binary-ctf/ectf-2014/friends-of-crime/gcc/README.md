> This is bad. Very bad. You travel back in time, only to see that The Plague has finagled his way to the gcc dev team. What sort of mischief he can cause for the future from this point of power is hard to say... find out what he's up to immediately! [Here](gcc-1f056eb86b487b65ad92d89738ec5edc.tar.gz)'s a copy of GCC. We're pretty sure he's running something at <https://107.21.133.9/>.
