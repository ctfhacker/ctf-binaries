## Write-up

Let’s extract [the provided `rev100.zip` file](rev100.zip):

```bash
$ unzip rev100.zip
Archive:  rev100.zip
  inflating: rev100
```

The extracted `rev100` file looks like a hexdump:

```bash
$ file rev100
rev100: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators

$ cat rev100

Let’s restore it back to its original form using `xxd`:

```bash
$ xxd -r -p rev100
@�hflH�H@��4$H�H�@�hagH�@�H�4$H�@�H�@�h{pH�@�H�4$H�H@�hop@H�H�4$H�@H�@ hpoH�@0H�4$H�@@H�hpr@PH�H�4$@`H�H�@phetH�@�H�4$H�@�H�h@�}
H�H�@�4$H�H�@�H1�H�<@�
```

Hmm, most of it is garbage, but there are ASCII characters that match the expected flag format `flag{…}` in there as well. Looking more closely, it seems like there are occurrences of `h` followed by two characters that are part of the flag. After some fiddling we end up with this script:

```bash
$ sed "s/  / /g" rev100 | xxd -r | strings -n 1 | grep '^h' | cut -c 2- | tr -d '\n'
flag{poppopret}
```

The flag is `flag{poppopret}`.
