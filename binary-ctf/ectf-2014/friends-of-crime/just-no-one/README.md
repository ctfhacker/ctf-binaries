> Here’s your binary: [`setup.exe`](setup.exe)

## Write-up

The provided `setup.exe` file is a standard installation wizard.

As usual with these wizards, the second screen contains a very long license agreement that must be accepted before continuing the installation.

The next screen prompts for a password. Which password? Hmm… It’s possible to [crack it](http://maroueneboubakri.blogspot.com/2014/02/olympic-ctf-sochi-2014-binathlon-10.html) and then proceed with the installation, but that doesn’t really help, because when the executable is opened, it just repeats “You already saw the flag.”:

![You already saw the flag.](executable.png)

And indeed — after running `setup.exe` again and carefully reading the license agreement this time, we notice something unusual:

![7A. YOU MAY SUBMIT THIS TO GET TEN POINTS: ILOVEREADINGEULAS.](setup-4.png)

The flag is `ILOVEREADINGEULAS`.
