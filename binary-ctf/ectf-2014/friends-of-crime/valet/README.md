$ file pwn300
pwn300: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, not stripped
```

`pwn300` accepts a `port` argument and starts a service listening on that port. To run it locally, use:

```bash
$ ./pwn300 9001
```

In another window/tab, you can then connect to the service:

```bash
$ nc localhost 9001
