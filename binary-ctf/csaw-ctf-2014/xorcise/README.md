## Write-up

This is a somewhat detailed write-up by Xor0X from team [HacknamStyle](http://www.hacknamstyle.net/).

### Length checking vulnerabilities: Part One

By inspecting [the source code](xorcise.c) we see the binary is a service which listens on port 24001. New clients are handled in `int process_connection(int sockfd)`. This function reads one single packet, which is expected to be in the following format:

	struct cipher_data {
		/** Header: Unencrypted and unauthenticated */
	    uint8_t length; /** Length of the bytes array */
	    uint8_t key[8];
		/** Payload: Encrypted and (partly) authenticated */
	    uint8_t bytes[128];
	};

As the comments indicate, the header is sent unencrypted. In particular this header includes an 8-byte key (which is chosen by the client). Roughly speaking the `bytes` array is XORed with the key in blocks of 8 bytes. The function doing this decryption is `decipher(data, output)`, which will be investigated in more detail later on (because it contains a vulnerability). The `length` field the header contains the actual size of the `bytes` array. This must be smaller or equal to 128. An attempt is made to assure the given length is valid:

    cipher_data encrypted;
    ssize_t bytes_read = recv(sockfd, (uint8_t *)&encrypted, sizeof(encrypted), 0);
    if (encrypted.length > bytes_read)
        return -1;

However this check is flawed. **Variable `bytes_read` is the length of the packet including the header**, while the program will treat the `length` field as the size of the `bytes` array. This means that as an attacker we can force the length to be bigger than 128.

The second vulnerability is in `decipher(data, output)`. This function decrypts the `bytes` array using the key. Somewhat simplified we have the following code:

	uint32_t decipher(cipher_data *data, uint8_t *output)
	{
	    uint8_t buf[MAX_BLOCKS * BLOCK_SIZE];
	    uint32_t loop, block_index;

	    memcpy(buf, data->bytes, sizeof(buf));

	    if ((data->length / BLOCK_SIZE) > MAX_BLOCKS)
	        data->length = BLOCK_SIZE * MAX_BLOCKS;

		// Block-decryption loop
	    for (loop = 0; loop < data->length; loop += 8)
	        for (block_index = 0; block_index < 8; ++block_index)
	            buf[loop+block_index] ^= (0x8F ^ data->key[block_index]);

	    memcpy(output, buf, sizeof(buf));
	}

Note that `data->bytes` is copied to a local buffer, and this local buffer is then processed. The first if-test is an attempt to assure that `data->length` is not bigger than the local buffer. However this checked is flawed because in **`(data->length / BLOCK_SIZE)` the intermediate result will be rounded down**. In particular, the following value will pass the length check:

	data->length = BLOCK_SIZE * MAX_BLOCKS + (BLOCK_SIZE - 1) = 135

And due to the first length check vulnerability, we know that `data->length` can indeed contain such values. The consequence of both vulnerabilities means that we can force the block-decryption loop to **decrypt an extra block of 8-bytes**. Since the local buffer is too small for this, we are capable of modifying local variables placed after the buffer. In particular we can overwrite `loop` and `block_index`.

### Length checking vulnerabilities: Part Two?

Interestingly, `decipher(data, output)` is the only function that uses the `length` field in the header. All other functions are coded in such a way that knowing this length is not required. This causes another peculiar observation: when setting `length` to zero, no decryption takes place, and the packet is processed as-is. This observation is not required to solve the challenge though (but it does make it easier to construct packets).

### Authentication and Commands

The above two vulnerabilities [are sufficient](https://gist.github.com/g05u/9e1ae04ad1252f709bb7) to exploit the challenge. However we had some problems doing this, and instead opted for another approach. Our approach relies on additional functionality of the challenge: letting it execute commands. We can execute three commands: (1) getting the current server time; (2) reading an arbitrary file; (3) executing a system command. The latter two commands required the packet to be authenticated. The client must provide a checksum equal to `H(H(password||key) || H(data||password))` for the packet to be authenticated. Here `password` is a secret loaded at startup, and `key` and `data` are chosen by the client. The function `H()` seems to be a custom (and insecure?) hash function.

### Exploitation

We use both length-check vulnerabilities to read the secret `password`. Once we have this, we can execute arbitrary system commands on the server, and exploitation becomes trivial.

In the `decipher(data, output)` function we overwrite the return address. This is done by first overwriting the local variable `loop`, such that the next xor-decrypt operation will point to the return address. We prevent other variables from being overwritten by XORing with zero. Recall that we can XOR 8 bytes in total, and in particular we XOR these bytes with the `key` in the header of the packet.


Where will we point the return address to? First observe that, because of the last `mempcy` call, the `eax` register contains a pointer to the local buffer when returning from the function. Hence the content pointed to by `eax` is under our control. If we now exploit the binary for interesting gadgets, we spot the following:

	.text:08049290                 mov     eax, [ebp+packet]
	.text:08049293                 add     eax, 8
	.text:08049296                 sub     esp, 8
	.text:08049299                 push    eax             ; filename
	.text:0804929A                 push    [ebp+fd]        ; fd
	.text:0804929D                 call    read_file

This is the code that calls `read_file(sockfd, name)`. When returning from `decipher` the `ebp` register is restored, hence it correctly points to the local variables. However, variable `packet` is not yet initialized by the program, hence we can't use it. Instead we redirect code to `push eax; push [ebp+fd]`. Since `eax` points to the beginning of the buffer this code will successfully be executed. Putting the string `password.txt` in the start of the buffer will now make the service print out the password **pass123**. We can now send authenticated commands and execute arbitrary shell commands. The flag was in the file `flag.txt` in the same directory as `password.txt` (i.e. the current working directory).

Remark: the problem we encountered when directly calling `system(cmd)` was that it would overwrite the local buffer used in `decipher` (since it was saved on the stack). Recall that the pointer to this buffer was stored in `eax`. Luckily, in the `read_file` function, the stack is used in such a way so this didn't occur.
