# Hack.lu CTF 2014: Guess the Flag

**Description:**

> Look at that guy over there! He’s a bandit from the group that robs the stagecoaches in unpredictable intervals. I think he hasn’t been with them for very long, so he can’t tell whether you’re one of them. Try to look like a bandit and talk to him. He probably won’t just tell you their plan for the attack, but maybe you can ask him some questions?
