**Category:** Reversing
**Points:** 200
**Author:** cutz
**Description:**

> Silly Gunslinger Joe has learned from his mistakes with his private terminal and now tries to remember passwords. But he’s gotten more paranoid and chose to develope an additional method: protect all his private stuff with a secure locking mechanism that no one would be able to figure out! He’s so confident with this new method that he even started using it to protect all his precious gold. So… we better steal all of it!
