**Description:**

> You were approached by a sheriff, who was thrown out of his own town, called Elkhorn. It had been a normal town, profiting from the gold rush and having its occasional salon fights, until Manning showed up with some futuristic weapons… So armed with your two colts and a rifle you set out for Elkhorn with the sheriff. In Elkhorn you ran across three men and a woman, called Bruce, John, David and Diana. With their help Manning wasn’t that hard to beat after all. After the fight they disappeared to… well let’s just say they were from the future and had some trouble of their own. On the ground where Bruce and David struggled, before they disappeared, you find a small item. Maybe you can find out what it’s used for and how to use it? You’ve overheard Bruce saying to Diana, that he’s glad to have changed to the latest version of the operating system, because it kept on crashing before.
